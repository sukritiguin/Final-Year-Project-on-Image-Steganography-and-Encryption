# LSBSteganography Algorithm Documentation:


Steganography is the practice of concealing secret information within a carrier medium, such as text, image, audio, or video, in a way that the existence of the hidden information is not apparent to unintended recipients. Unlike cryptography, which focuses on making the content of a message unreadable to unauthorized users, steganography aims to hide the fact that a secret message exists.

LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography is a common technique used to hide information within digital images. In LSB steganography, the least significant bits of the pixel values in an image are altered to encode the hidden data. Since the least significant bits have the least impact on the visual appearance of the image, modifying them does not significantly alter the image's perceptual quality. LSB steganography is particularly effective because it allows for the hiding of data within an image while minimizing the noticeable changes to the image's appearance.

The process of LSB steganography typically involves the following steps:

1. **Selecting a Cover Medium**: A digital image is chosen as the cover medium to conceal the secret message.
2. **Converting Data**: The secret message, which can be text, another image, or any digital data, is converted into a binary format.
3. **Embedding Data**: The binary data is then embedded into the least significant bits of the pixel values of the cover image. Each pixel in the image typically consists of three color channels (e.g., red, green, blue in an RGB image), and the least significant bit of each channel is modified to encode a bit of the secret message.
4. **Retrieving Data**: To extract the hidden message from the stego image, the LSBs of the pixel values are examined and decoded to reconstruct the original binary data. This data is then converted back into its original format to reveal the hidden message.

LSB steganography is widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, it may not be suitable for transmitting highly sensitive information as it can be vulnerable to detection by adversaries with sophisticated analysis techniques. Additionally, LSB steganography is primarily applicable to digital images and may not be suitable for other types of media.
